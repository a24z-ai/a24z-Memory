# Introduction

This guide explains how to configure your AI coding assistant to use A24z Memory effectively. The integration allows your AI agent to access project-specific knowledge and tribal wisdom.

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Query Existing Knowledge

When starting work on a new feature or file:

```
User: "I need to implement user authentication for this React app"

AI Agent: Uses askA24zMemory with filePath and query about authentication patterns
```

### 2. Apply Project Patterns

The AI agent receives context about existing authentication decisions and applies them:

- Uses established libraries (e.g., JWT vs sessions)
- Follows project conventions for error handling
- Applies consistent code patterns

### 3. Document New Insights

After implementing solutions, the AI agent creates notes:

```json
{
  "note": "Implemented OAuth 2.0 integration using Auth0 following project pattern of external auth providers",
  "directoryPath": "/src/auth",
  "tags": ["authentication", "oauth", "auth0", "integration"],
  "type": "decision"
}
```

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Proactive Knowledge Queries

Configure your AI agent to automatically query A24z Memory when:

- Opening unfamiliar files or directories
- Starting new features or components
- Encountering complex logic or patterns
- Making architectural decisions

### Context-Aware Assistance

The AI agent can provide more relevant help by:

1. **Understanding project structure** - Knowing where components, APIs, and utilities are located
2. **Following established patterns** - Applying consistent code style and architecture
3. **Leveraging past decisions** - Building on previous architectural choices
4. **Avoiding common pitfalls** - Learning from documented mistakes and solutions

### Team Knowledge Sharing

Use A24z Memory to:

- **Standardize practices** across team members
- **Accelerate onboarding** for new developers
- **Preserve institutional knowledge** when team members leave
- **Create living documentation** that evolves with the codebase

## Troubleshooting Integration

### AI Agent Doesn't Recognize Tools

1. **Verify MCP Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Test if server starts
   npx a24z-memory start
   ```

2. **Check System Prompt**
   - Ensure the tool definitions are correctly formatted
   - Verify the AI agent supports MCP tools

3. **Restart Editor**
   - Completely restart your editor after configuration changes
   - Check editor logs for MCP-related errors

### No Notes Found

This is expected for new repositories. The AI agent should:

1. Create initial notes about project structure
2. Document setup and configuration decisions
3. Note important conventions and patterns
4. Record architectural choices

### Performance Issues

If queries are slow:

1. **Check repository size** - Large repositories may need optimization
2. **Verify file permissions** - Ensure A24z Memory can access all files
3. **Monitor memory usage** - Large knowledge bases require more resources

## Best Practices for Teams

### Team-Wide Adoption

1. **Standardize system prompts** - Use the same integration rules across the team
2. **Establish tagging conventions** - Create consistent categories for notes
3. **Regular knowledge reviews** - Periodically review and update notes
4. **Encourage documentation** - Make note creation part of the development process

### Knowledge Management

1. **Quality over quantity** - Focus on high-value, actionable notes
2. **Regular maintenance** - Review and update outdated information
3. **Cross-team sharing** - Share relevant notes across related projects
4. **Version control** - Keep knowledge base in sync with code changes

### AI Agent Training

1. **Contextual examples** - Provide examples of good vs. bad queries
2. **Feedback loops** - Learn from successful and unsuccessful interactions
3. **Custom guidance** - Add project-specific guidance to system prompts
4. **Iterative improvement** - Refine integration based on team feedback
